Could you please explain the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that your current office follows ?

At my current office, we follow an Agile-based SDLC. Let me explain you quickly.
step 1:Requirements Gathering – We collaborate with stakeholders to define requirements in user stories.
step 2: Planning – We conduct sprint planning to prioritize tasks and set clear deliverables and prepare sprint plab clearly.
step 3: Design & Development : The backend and frontend developers should be assigned, and they will receive the requirements and participate in story grooming sessions before starting their work. After getting proper KT, they will start their work and complete the sprint tasks.
step 4: Testing - Developers will perform a one-time manual unit test before releasing it to the testing team. If everything is fine, they will hand it over to the testing team, who will test it and provide feedback on the user stories. The developers will then fix the issues.
step 5: Deployment – We use CI/CD pipelines for smooth, automated deployments.
step 6: Review: after each sprint we conduct a meeting to enhance the process.
