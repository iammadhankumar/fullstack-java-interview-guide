1. **What is Docker?**  
   Docker is a platform used for building, deploying, and running applications in portable containers.  
   It ensures consistency, scalability, and efficiency across different environments.  

2. **Explain about Kubernetes?**

   It automates scaling and load balancing by default.  

3. **Difference between Docker and Kubernetes?**  

   **Docker:**
   - Helps create and run containers.
   - Scaling is not by default, needs tools like Docker Swarm.
   - Requires manual handling of container restarts and failures.
   - Best for running single or small containerized applications.

   **Kubernetes:**
   - Automatically manages and scales multiple containers.
   - Scales applications up or down based on traffic.
   - Handles auto-restarts, load balancing, and failure recovery.
   - Best for managing large applications with many containers.
